# Parallel Maximum Alternating Subsequence Length

Python 3 implementation of BSP maximum length of an alternating subsequence.

i.e. this: 

Q2 of potentially the most unreasonable assignment ever received by a set of humans.

Works for ints/floats and even ridiculous cases where all the numbers sent to a
processor are equal.

> Let a be a number array of size n. A subset of k indices 0 ≤ i_0 < i_1 < ... < i_k−1 < n

> Design an efficient BSP algorithm to determine the length k of the longest
